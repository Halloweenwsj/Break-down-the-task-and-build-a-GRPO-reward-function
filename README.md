# Break-down-the-task-and-build-a-GRPO-reward-function
This project attempts to decompose the complex task of scoring students' mathematical answers into smaller subtasks, enabling smaller models to perform more effectively. I employ GRPOreinforcement learning to break down the reward model's scoring task into multiple subtask evaluations, then aggregate these for a final reward,
